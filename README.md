hello-world
===========

Getting started with Github by setting up the obligatory 'hello-world' repository.

Above this line (6) is default content of the README.md file created by Github when the new repository was created. Line 6
and below was added to the file in the "edit" branch--Oddly, the name of the branch disappears when I start editing (by
clicking the 'pencil' icon), which seems a bit confusing, so something to pay attention to--make sure you're in the proper
branch before editing files.
